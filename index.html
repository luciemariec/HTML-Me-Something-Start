               <h2>Lawrence Public Schools - Schwegler Elementary School</h2>
               <h3>2019-Present</h3>
               <p class="funParagraph">
               I have been a 5th grade teacher for the past 5 years! My favorite part of my current role is preparing students for middle school both socially and academically. 
               It's easy to forget that 5th graders are just big KIDS! Currently, I am participating in a program called <a href="https://www.cs.ksu.edu/cyber-pipeline/curriculum/">Cyber Pipeline</a> which is funded by a grant through Kansas State University. 
               In addition to LaunchCode, I am taking courses that will help me introduce the foundational concepts of Computer Science to my 5th graders and show them the benefits of learning to code!
               Many 5th graders mention big aspirations of becoming "YouTubers" one day - I am hoping I can show them there are other paths to take.

               <h3>2018-2019</h3>
               <p class="funParagraph">
                  My first teaching job was at a dual-language school! I taught a group of aspiring bilingual 1st graders Reading & Math in English, while Science and Social Studies were taught in Spanish.
                  While I enjoyed working with this age group, I needed to find a job with a shorter commute.
